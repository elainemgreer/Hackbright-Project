# LiveList
> LiveList is a full-stack web application to find and store musical events. It allows users to search either by geolocation or by city and see events in both map and list view. Users can also store their favorite events into a personalized events list; from this list they can see event details and get directions to events of their choice. 

This project was made at Hackbright Academy in San Francisco over four weeks in February-March 2020.
